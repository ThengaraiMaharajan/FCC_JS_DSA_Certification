primitive
non primitive -> objects



JavaScript has seven primitive data types, with String being one of them. In JavaScript, a string represents a sequence of characters and can be enclosed in either single (') or double (") quotes.
Note that strings are immutable, which means once they are created, they cannot be changed.
Change your "Hello" string to use single quotes.
